Implementation of Top trading cycle (TTC) algorithm in Python by using v-agent oriented programming (VAOP) paradigm
## v-agent oriented programming (VAOP)
v-agent oriented programming (VAOP) is a programming methodology based on a v-agent script representation of an algorithm that allows a software agent, called v-agent, to perform operations encoded in the v-agent box.  
  
  Ideologically v-agent-oriented programming - ensures that the algorithm is written in one place in a form that is understandable to everyone - customers, programmers and the executing environment (computer), which improves the process of interaction between everyone when creating a software product and, which is especially important, significantly reduces costs at the stage of maintaining work and adapting to changes in external conditions in the future. 
  
The paradox is that we must change in order for everything to remain the same, therefore the main task of v-agent oriented programming is to ensure the immortality of the software product with minimal investment in its constant modernization.
  
  Knowledge of the v-agent-oriented approach to programming will be useful not only for developers who receive money for no matter what methodology the software product is made, but for customers who are left alone for many years with the problems of maintaining the operation of a software product and adapting it to changes in external conditions. Remember that the future does not come by itself! We program what we will deal with in the future skillfully or not skillfully, so you need to create your software using v-agent oriented programming in order for you to have a Future.  
  It sounds vague and not concrete, but without a theory it is impossible, since there is nothing in the world more practical than a good theory.  
  
VAOP paradigm is a part of eco-programming paradigm. For more details visit https://github.com/vrakitine/eco-programming-paradigm
